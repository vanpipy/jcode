# jcode Telemetry Worker

Cloudflare Worker that receives anonymous telemetry events from jcode.

## Setup

1. Install wrangler: `npm install`

2. Create D1 database:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 create jcode-telemetry
   ```

3. Update `wrangler.toml` with the database ID from step 2

4. Initialize schema:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --file=schema.sql
   ```

### Migrating an existing database

If your production database was created before the latest telemetry fields were added,
apply all remote migrations:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0001_expand_events.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0002_transport_metrics.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0003_usage_expansion.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0004_telemetry_phase123.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0005_workflow_turn_telemetry.sql
```

Then redeploy the worker:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

5. Deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

6. Set up custom domain (optional): point `telemetry.jcode.dev` to the worker in Cloudflare dashboard

### Ops helpers

```

## What to watch for

- `session_start` far exceeding `session_end + session_crash` for multiple days
- `session_crash = 0` for long periods despite known crashes
- large `lifecycle_ids_without_install` counts
- a single telemetry ID dominating session totals (dev/test skew)
- zeroed transport totals after transport-aware releases (missing migration)
- `daily_active_users` row counts diverging from raw distinct-user checks
- headline DAU including `build_channel != 'release'` or raw event counts instead of distinct users

## Accuracy notes

- DAU/WAU/MAU should be distinct `telemetry_id` counts, never event counts. Heavy users and long-running agents can emit thousands of `turn_end` events in a day.
- Use `meaningful_release_active` for headline product usage. It excludes local/dev/git-checkout traffic and open/close sessions with no meaningful lifecycle activity.
- Raw events remain the source of truth. The `daily_active_users` table is an ingest-time rollup for cheap dashboard queries and is backfillable from `events`.
- The worker uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` keyed by `event_id`; rollups and detail rows are updated only when the canonical raw event insert succeeds, so client retries do not inflate counts.
- Telemetry still undercounts users who opt out (`JCODE_NO_TELEMETRY`, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, `~/.jcode/no_telemetry`) or whose network blocks telemetry, and may overcount one person using multiple machines.
